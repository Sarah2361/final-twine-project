Her second serve is a good kick serve, and you miss the return with a forehand error.

You strike a return and it becomes a ten shot rally. It ends with you striking a clean backhand winner down the line. 

The crowd erupts into applause. This gives you a huge confidence boost, even though its only the first point of the match. 

It's amazing how much of a confidence boost winning the first point can give you. 


[[You take the first game]]

&lt;img class="story-image" src="./images/racket.jpg" alt="racket" /&gt;  



The crowd cheers. A lot of them are yelling out Dani's name, some are yelling your name. 
You slowly make your way up to the line and take a deep breath, shutting your eyes and reopening them. 

You tell yourself you're ready. 

You crouch down into a half-squat position, turning the racket in your hands, preparing yourself for the return. 

Dani bounces the ball a few times before looking down at your end. She turns and draws back, tossing the ball in the air. Her first serve

[[Ready]]  

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="The toss" tags="" position="475,375" size="100,100">
"Heads or tails, Miss Young?" 

The umpire looks at you. 

You think for a moment. For the last six rounds you've picked heads, and you've won those matches, so the obvious choice is to keep it the same. However, you've been in this position before, and continued the streak of picking heads, only to end up losing the final round. So it's 50/50 nontheless. 

"Tails," you tell the umpire. 

The young girl standing next to the umpire tosses the coin in the air. It lands on heads. Dani chooses to serve. You decide to stay at your end. After two photos are taken (one with you, Dani and the coin tosser, one with just you and Dani) you jog back to the baseline and signal for balls. The crowd cheers. 

[[warm up]] 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="14" name="The day of the match" tags="" position="350,500" size="100,100">You are in a waiting room. Dani is standing in the opposite corner. Neither of you have made eye contact with each other. 

An official comes over and gives both of you a signal to follow him.  

You hoist your tennis bag onto your back and follow Dani down the hallway.  

The hallway is lined with photos of previous champions; each one becoming more recent as you pass. 

You can start to hear the noise from the crowd. At this point, you're filled with about 20% excitement and the remaining 80% is pure angst.  

You've been in this position before, and it devastated you when it didn’t go your way. You don't want a repeat of that. Over a billion different thoughts fly through your brain before you near the entrance to the court. The feeling of angst intensifies with each step forwards. 
Time seems to slowdown in these few remaining seconds before you step out in front of the crowd. The noise from outside is now like a swarm of bees hovering in front of you. Both you and Dani pause at the entrance to the arena. Dani's name is called first through the speakers. The crowd erupts as she walks out and waves to them. 

They then announce her opponent. The official gestures for you to walk out. You take a deep breath before putting on your most confident smile and heading out onto the court. You wave at the crowd, and they erupt into cheers and applause.  

[[The toss]] 

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="15" name="Your opponent" tags="" position="350,625" size="100,100">Dani Makris was seeded second going into the tournament. The number one seed retired during the second round due to a back injury. Dani is now the favourite.  

 
Her first serve is a hard smack that's targeted at two places:  out wide on your backhand, or straight at your body. Both strikes are enough to upset any player. She strikes the ball well, and manages to run down every ball. Her last six matches she won fairly easily, although her third round match was close. Her entourage includes her coach, her physio, her mind coach, her partner and a few of her friends.  

  
Yours includes just your coach and your physio. 





[[The day of the match]] 


</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="16" name="background story" tags="" position="225,750" size="100,100">Tennis is a strange game - the favourites can crash out early; the underdogs can win the title. Anyone can lose at any time. Often, you're most vulnerable when you're ahead.  

50% of a tennis match is mentality. Maybe even more. Mentality can often be seen as more important than the physical aspect. 


Strategy is important. 
On-court intelligence is very important. 
Being able to sniff out your opponent's weaknesses early is important.   

Your ability to come back and win when you're losing a match is all to do with what you tell yourself in those hard moments.  

 
[[road to final]] 


</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="17" name="road to final" tags="" position="475,1000" size="100,100">You've won six matches in a row. The first two you won easily - they were in two sets. The third was a three-set battle but you managed to pull through. The fourth was won in two sets but was difficult. The fifth won in three sets. The sixth surprisingly not too difficult - your opponent was carrying an injury, so they weren't at their best.  

  
Now you're in the final. And you're up against Dani Makris - a strong player. A player you haven't beaten before. And just the thought of her being in the way of your first title fills you with angst. 

You are now in your hotel bedroom. You're attempting to quiet your nerves by doing some meditation. Upon your request, your team hasn't disturbed you for the last couple of hours. 

You need this time to be alone - to calm your thoughts. 

 
[[Your opponent]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="18" name="aces you" tags="" position="725,1125" size="100,100">Theres nothing you can do. The crowd applauds. This knocks your confidence so much so that you now face every point she serves with trepidation.  


It's going to be a tough match for you. 


[[her next serve]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="19" name="You take the first game" tags="" position="300,1000" size="100,100">You change ends. It's now going to be your serve. You take a sip of water at your seat - you want to have enough to give you energy but not too much. 

You walk over to the other end and the ball kid throws you a couple of balls.  

You make your way to the right side of the baseline.  
 
You line up your serve, aiming it to her weaker shot: her backhand.  
 
You end up winning the next game, leading 2-0. 

She then wins the following game.  

[[The score:]]

Although you're leading by one game, this still boosts your confidence.  

You try not to get ahead of yourself.  

You can hear your coach box clapping, and you look up to them in the stands.  

Your coach gives you a signal to 'calm down.' You nod, enough to confirm that you've heard him.  

Whilst you sit and collect your thoughts at the change of ends, you open a bottle of Gatorade and take a drink.  

The trick here is to not get too ahead of the game. Stay with it. Don't think ahead to the end of the match, the end of this set or even the next game (which you'll be serving).  

You try and stay with the game - if she's too good, she's too good.  

You remind yourself that you don't care if she wins this match.  

The umpire calls time.

[[Set 2]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="23" name="Set 2" tags="" position="300,1625" size="100,100">During the second set, you're not off to a good start. You miss a few serves, and make a few unforced errors on your returns, while Dani starts to become more consistent. And before you know it - you're 4-1 down.  

You look up at your coach box. They all look concerned. You can hear Dani's supporters in the crowd becoming louder. It's starting to affect how you think.  

On the change of ends you know something has to change - otherwise this set could be finished in the next 10 minutes.  

You take another banana out of your bag, and you start to peel it. It's a strange thing - but peeling bananas has always been a therapeutic thing for you - something that's helped clear your mind. You start to remind yourself of what you do best on the court: Your forehand is a weapon, your backhand down the line is strong. Dani's backhand is her weakest shot - so maybe try and expose that a bit more.  

Also, you could mix it up: add a drop shot, some slices, throw in a high ball - anything to throw her off. 

[[reset]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="24" name="Next game" tags="" position="300,1375" size="100,100">You end up taking the first set 6-1.  

A small part of your brain starts whooping and cheering. You brush it aside. You know better than to start getting ahead - that's when it can become dangerous, and can potentially lead to devastating consequences. 

Your coach box is clapping.  

"Reset! Reset!" Your coach is calling to you.  

You give a small nod.  
  
You can hear Dani start to complain to her box. Her entourage is attempting to calm her down.  
  
You block them out. You know from experience that it's a distraction when you give your opponent too much attention. Whilst you're sitting on your bench, unpeeling a banana, you can still hear Dani complaining about her game on the other side of the umpire. You pretend they don't exist - you pretend you're the only person playing this match. 

You try to back yourself in the next few games. 

[[The next step]] 


</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="25" name="reset" tags="" position="300,1750" size="100,100">You manage to crawl your way back to level Dani at 4-4. The pressure is now on. 2 more games and you've won the match. Dani takes 2 more games, and she's won the second set, pushing you to a third.  

Unfortunately, you get so wrapped up in the fact that you're so close to the title, that you choke on your service game and miss a few returns.  

Dani takes the second set 6-4. 


[[set 2 score now:]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="26" name="set 2 score now:" tags="" position="300,1875" size="100,100">(set: $typewriterText to "

[[set 3]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="27" name="set 3" tags="" position="300,2000" size="100,100">You're starting off this final set. It's on your serve and it's now your time to take control if you want to win this match. After a debrief with your coach box, you know what to do: do what you did at the start - don't worry about the final result.  

Be ok with losing. Play how you wanted to play. She's going to play how she wants to, and so should you.  

The crowds jeering and carrying on. You go into your own head.  

You stand and walk up to the line, positioning yourself and looking down the other end. Dani is holding you up for a second longer, then you see her hand drop and she gets into position. You bounce the ball 5 times, because 5 is your lucky number. You pull your arm back and strike the first serve. 


[[The winner cross court]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="28" name="The winner cross court" tags="" position="300,2125" size="100,100">You win the first game off a cross-court forehand winner at 40-30. 

You then end up leading 3-2 in the final set. Dani then catches up to you and levels it at 3-3. 



[[Your next service game]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="29" name="Your next service game" tags="" position="300,2250" size="100,100">
&lt;img class="story-image" src="./images/excitedcrowd.gif" alt="excitedcrowd" /&gt; 

You lead 5-4. Dani serves out a great game to level it at 5-5.  

This is where the pressure builds. You can feel it from the crowd. You look to your coach box. Their concerned faces are a distraction, so you look away. You don't dare look at Dani or her team. You tell yourself once again what you went into this match thinking: It doesn't matter if you lose - but what does matter is that you've given it your all.  

You’re now ready.  

You nod to the ball kid to throw you a ball. You then walk yourself up to the baseline and glance down the other end. 

[[Your first serve]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="30" name="Your first serve" tags="" position="300,2375" size="100,100">You play a great service game. You can see Dani is now starting to feel the pressure. You can see it in the way she expresses her frustration to her team.

[[the final moments]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="32" name="the final moments" tags="" position="300,2625" size="100,100">The score is 30 all. Dani is serving. She misses the first serve. This spikes some hope in you. You can see she's now starting to tense up. You’re only 2 points away from victory.  

Her second serve lands in and you smack a forehand down the line, exposing her weak backhand. She barely touches the ball with her racket. 

The crowd roars.  

You’re now just 1 point away from victory.  

You choose not to look at your team - although you can sense them starting to get all ecstatic and excited. Dani looks stressed down the other end. This is exactly what you want.  

The last thing you want to do is care too much about how this next point turns out.  

 
[[championship point]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="33" name="championship point" tags="" position="300,2750" size="100,100">

Dani's first serve lands in. You strike a forehand down the middle. Her next shot is a nice forehand cross court - but you read it early and make a powerful return back to her forehand. She targets your backhand, but you reach that as well. She starts scrambling for answers. 

After hitting a forehand she runs into the net. But its not a good shot to come in on and you easily return it with a forehand winner down the line. 


[[the crowd]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="34" name="the crowd" tags="" position="300,2875" size="100,100">You've won!! It takes a solid few moments for you to realise whats just happened. You've finally beaten Dani, you've taken the title. You are now the womens singles champion!

You go to meet Dani at the net and shake her hand, telling her "Good game."

This isn't ideal, and you start to become frustrated.  

You start to panic - things are now looking exactly like the last final you were in - which you lost. Your head starts to spin. You're trying desperately to come up with answers.  

On the change of ends you sit down and have a drink, hoping this will help calm your thoughts.

&lt;img class="story-image" src="./images/bart.gif" alt="bart" /&gt;  

You go to the umpire and ask if you can leave to go to the bathroom. He finds someone to accompany you there.  

Once you've closed the cubicle door, you take a deep breath and sit on top of the toilet seat. You just sit there. You can hear the music playing in the arena, the whoops and cheers from the crowd. They're probably participating in a giant Mexican wave or something.  

You know you're going to have to do something amazing to be able to turn this match around.  

You start thinking. 

Maybe you just need to hit more balls in. The ratio of unforced errors seems to be 20% Dani and 80% you.

"Just hit more balls in the court" you tell yourself. "Be more consistent. You've got this." 

[[You re-enter the arena]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="41" name="You re-enter the arena" tags="" position="725,1875" size="100,100">You start the second set off on your service game. You manage to take the first game at 40-30, so it wasn't as quick as you would've liked. Your aim is to try and get yourself out of jail in this set.  

At some point you end up leading this set 3-2. You’re starting to get closer.

[[Prepare for the next game]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="43" name="Prepare for the next game" tags="" position="725,2125" size="100,100">You're leading 3-2 in this second set. You start to imagine what it would be like if you started to lead 4-2? 5-2? Maybe you could even take the second set. Your hopes are short lived as Dani serves a great service game, hitting two aces and barely missing a first serve. That levels the score to 3-3. 

You're distracted, but you try not to lose momentum in the next game. 

But you end up losing the next game, bringing it to 4-3.

You don't feel too good on this change of ends. 


[[Your coach box]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="44" name="Your coach box" tags="" position="725,2250" size="100,100">You look up at your coach box to try and get answers. You can't look at them - their faces are too distracting.  

During the next game Dani also looks like she's distracted, and you hit a couple of winners. You end up taking the next game, bringing the score to 4-4. It's tight. You can feel everyone in the crowd is now fully engaged in this match. They're anticipating what is going to happen next. So is your coach box. So is Dani’s coach box.  

You serve a shaky next game, ending on a double fault. Dani now leads 5-4. 

 

[[The end of the second set]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="45" name="The end of the second set" tags="" position="725,2375" size="100,100">This game is on Dani's serve. She wins the first two points. The crowd is going crazy. She only needs two more to take the title. You start rapidly perspiring. The thought of losing is starting to creep up on you. A horrible reality, and now you're doing everything you can to keep yourself alive in this match.

The score ends up coming to 40-30. Match point for Dani. You’re still in this match, but only just.  

The final point plays out. Dani serves a good serve, not an ace, but it’s good enough to get you stretched out wide.  

The point ends where Dani hits a backhand winner down the line.

Congratulations! You're runner up! 









[[Play]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="47" name="15-love" tags="" position="225,875" size="100,100">Dani wins the next point. Now its 30-love. Although it is early days in this match, you know how easy it can be for someone to get ahead and to remain out of reach. You reset yourself, winning the next point where Dani misses a cross-court backhand. 

Although you end up losing the first game, an attitude of defeat still hasn't hit you. Yet.  


[[Dani leads 2-1]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="48" name="Dani leads 2-1" tags="" position="100,1000" size="100,100">On the change of ends you can hear your team yelling out instructions. Although you're aware that this is meant to be helpful, it has the opposite effect. Rather than helping you remain calm, it stresses you out. 


[[You lose the next game]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="49" name="You lose the next game" tags="" position="100,1125" size="100,100">You're 3-1 down.  

It's now back on Dani's serve.  

During this game, Dani only misses one first serve. Most of the rallies end on one of your errors.  

On one point, you have an opportunity: Dani hits a ball in the air, and you come in for an approach shot. There seems to be an endless number of opportunities as to how to win this point. You end up rushing and over-thinking the shot and the ball goes into the net. You hear Dani yell out "Come on!" and the crowd cheers.  

You’ve had enough. You’re too stressed for this. You raise your racket and bring it down to the ground.   
  

&lt;img class="story-image" src="./images/smash1.gif" alt="smash" /&gt;   

 

You start yelling at your team for stressing you out.  You pick up your racket (now with a broken frame) and head over to your bags to replace it.  

[[You're now 5-1 down]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="50" name="You&#39;re now 5-1 down" tags="" position="100,1250" size="100,100">The crowd is now jeering and booing. You know you're going to have to face your team after and apologize for your behaviour. The umpire issues you a code violation. 

You sit down, feeling embarrassed, defeated and guilty. You can hear your coach telling you to move on and forget about it, to just concentrate on the next game. 

You've been brought up to not throw tantrums like this. Some people say it's a good thing - it's a release; you're letting your anger out rather than holding it in. But you can't seem to shake that feeling of guilt. 



You end up losing the next game.
