Her second serve is a good kick serve, and you miss the return with a forehand error.

You strike a return and it becomes a ten shot rally. It ends with you striking a clean backhand winner down the line. 

The crowd erupts into applause. This gives you a huge confidence boost, even though its only teh first point of the match. 

It's amazing how much of a confidence boost winning the first poinnt can get you. 


[[You win the first game]]

The crowd cheers. A lot of them are yelling out Dani's name, some are yelling your name. 
You slowly make your way up to the line and take a deep breath, shutting your eyes fror a second. 

You tell yourself youre ready. 

You crouch down into a half-squat position, turning the raacket in your hands, preparing yoursel ffo the return. 

Dani bounces the ball a few times before looking down at your end. She turhen draaws baack and tosses the ball in the air. Her first serve

[[Ready]]  

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="The toss" tags="" position="475,375" size="100,100">
"Heads or tails, Miss Young?" 

The umpire looks at you. 

You think for a moment. For the last six rounds you've picked heads, and you've won those matches, so the obvious choice is to keep it the same. However, you've been in this position before, and continued the streak of piccking heads, only to lose teh final round. So it could really go either way. 

"Tails," you tell the umpire. 

The young girl tosses the coin in the air. It lands on heads. Dani chooses to serve. You decide to stay at your end. After two photos are taken (one with you, Dani and the coin tosser, one with just you and Dani) you job back to the baseline and signal for balls. The crowd erupts. 

[[warm up]] 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="14" name="Get ready " tags="" position="350,500" size="100,100">An official comes over and gives both you and Dani a signal to follow them.  

You hoist your tennis bag onto your back and follow Dani down the hallway.  

The hallway is lined with photos of previous champions; each one you pass becoming more recent than the previous photo.  

You can start to hear the noise from the crowd, which fills you with about 20% excitement and the remaining 80% pure angst.  

Youve been in this position before, and it devastated you when it didnâ€™t go your way. You don't want a repeat of that. Over a billion different thoughts fly through your brain before you near the entrance to the court. Each step forwards filling you with angst that intensifies with each step. Time seems to slowdown in these few remaining seconds before you step out in front of the crowd. The noise from outside is now like a swarm of bees hovering just in front of you. Dani's name is called first through the speakers. The crowd erupts as she walks out and waves to them. Then they announce her opponent. the official gestures for you to walk out. You take a deep breath before putting on your most confident smile and heading out onto the court. You wave at the crowd, and they erupt into cheers and applause.  

[[The toss]] 

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="15" name="Your opponent" tags="" position="350,625" size="100,100">Dani Makris was seeded second going into the tournament. The number one seed retired during her second round due to a back injury. So Dani's now the favourite.  

  

Her first serve is a hard smack that is mainly targeted at two places: either out wide on the backhand, or straight at your body. Both are enough to upset any player. She strikes the ball well, and she manages to run down every ball. Her last six matches she won fairly easily, although her third round match was close. Her entourage includes her coach, her physio, her mind coach, her partner and a few of her friends.  

  

Yours includes just your coach and physio. 








[[Get ready ]] 


</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="16" name="background story" tags="" position="225,750" size="100,100">Tennis is a strange game - the favourites can crash out early; the underdogs can end up winning the title. Anyone can lose at any time. Sometimes you're at your most vulnerable when you're ahead.  

50% of a tennis match is mentality. Maybe even more. You would even go as far as to say that mental strength is more important than the physical.   

Strategy is important. On-court intelligence is very important. Being able to sniff out your opponent's weaknesses early is important.   

Your ability to come back and win when you're losing a match is all to do with what you tell yourself in those bad moments.  

 
[[road to final]] 


</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="17" name="road to final" tags="" position="475,1000" size="100,100">You've won six matches in a row. Your first two you won easily - they were in two sets. The third a three-set battle but you managed to pull through. The fourth was won in two sets but was difficult. the fifth was one in three sets. the sixth was surprisingly not too difficult - your opponent was carrying an injury, so they weren't at their best.  

  

Now you're in the final. and you're up against Dani Makris - a strong player. one that you haven't ever beaten before. Just the thought of her being in the way of your first title fills you with angst. You try to quiet your nerves by doing some meditation. Youve asked your team not to disturb you for the next couple of hours. You need this time to be alone - to calm your thoughts. 

 


[[Your opponent]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="18" name="aces you" tags="" position="725,1125" size="100,100">Theres nothing you can do. The crowd applauds. This knocks your confidence so much so that you now face every point she serves with trepidation.  


It's going to be a tough match for you. 


[[her next serve]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="19" name="You win the first game" tags="" position="300,1000" size="100,100">You change ends. It's now going to be your serve. You take a sip of water at your seat - you want to have enough to give you energy but not too much.  

You walk over to the other end and the ball kid throws you a couple of balls.  

You make your way to the right side of the baseline.  
 
You line up your serve, aiming it to her weaker shot: her backhand.  
 
You win the next game, leading 2-0. She then wins the following game

Although you're leading by one game, this still boosts your confidence.  

You try not to get ahead of yourself.  

You can hear your coach box clapping, and you look up to them in the stands.  

Your coach gives you a signal to 'calm down.' You nod, enough to confirm that you understand him.  

Whilst you sit and collect your thoughts, you open the bottle of Gatorade and take a drink.  

The trick here is to not get too ahead of the game. Stay with it. Don't think ahead to the end of the match, the end of this set or even the next game (which you'll be serving).  

You stay with the game - if she's too good, she's too good.  

You remind yourself that you don't care if she wins this match.  

The umpire calls time.

[[Set 2]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="23" name="Set 2" tags="" position="300,1625" size="100,100">During the second set, you're not off to a good start. You miss a few serves, make a few unforced errors on your returns, whilst Dani starts to become more consistent. Before you know it - you're 4-1 down.  

You look up at your coach box. They all look concerned. You can hear Dani's supporters in the crowd becoming louder and more raucous. It's starting to affect how you think.  

On the change of ends you know something has to change - otherwise this set could be finished in the next 10 minutes.  

You take another banana out of your bag, and you start to peel it. It's a strange thing - but peeling bananas has always been a therapeutic thing for you - something that's helped you to think better. You start to remind yourself of what you do best on the court: Your forehand is a weapon, your backhand down the line is strong. Dani's backhand is her weakest shot - so maybe try and expose that a bit more.  

Also, you could mix it up: add a drop shot, some slices, throw in a high ball - anything to throw her off. 

[[restart]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="24" name="Next game" tags="" position="300,1375" size="100,100">You end up taking the first set 6-1.  

A small part of your brain starts whooping and cheering. You immediately silence it. You know better than to start getting ahead. That's when it can become dangerous, let alone lead to devastation.  

Your coach box is clapping.  

"Reset! Reset!" Your coach is calling to you.  

You give a small nod, enough to confirm you've heard him.  
  
You can hear Dani start to complain to her box. Her entourage is attempting to calm her down.  
  
You block them out. You know from experience that it's a distraction when you give your opponent too much attention. Whilst you're sitting on your bench, unpeeling a banana, you can still hear Dani complaining about her game on the other side of the umpire. You pretend they don't exist - as if you're the only person playing this match, and you back yourself on the next few games. 

[[The next step]] 


</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="25" name="restart" tags="" position="300,1750" size="100,100">You crawl your way back to level Dani at 4-4. The pressure is now on. 2 more games and youve won the mathc. Dani taakes 2 morre games and shes won the second set, pushing you to a third. 

Unfortuanltey, you get so wrapped up in the fact tht youre so clcose to the title, thata you cchoke on your servvicce game and miss a few returns. 

Dani takes the second set 6-4.

[[set 3]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="27" name="set 3" tags="" position="300,2000" size="100,100">You're starting off this final set. It's on your servve and its now your time to tke control if you want to win this match. after a debrief with your coach box, you know what to do. Do what you did at the start - dont worry abotu the final result. Be ok with losing. Play how to wanted to play. She's ghonna play how she wannts to - you need to maake sure youre doing the same. 

The crowds jeering and carrying on. You go into your own head. 

You positionn yourself at the line and look down the other end. Dani is holdikng you up,then you see her get into position. You bounce the ball 5 times, becuase 5 is yuour lucky number. You pull your arm back and strike the first serve. 


[[The winner cross court]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="28" name="The winner cross court" tags="" position="300,2125" size="100,100">You win the first game off a forehand winner cross court at 40-30.

[[Your next service game]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="29" name="Your next service game" tags="" position="300,2250" size="100,100">You lead 5-4. Dai serves out a great gme to level it at 5-5. 


This is where the pressure builds. You can feel it from the crowd. You look to your coach box. Their concerned faces are a distraction so you choose to look away. You don't look at Danni or her team. Theyre even more of a distractionn. You tell yourself once again what you went innto this match thinning: It doesnt matter if you lose - but what does matter is that youve given it your absolite best. And if your teaam isnt happy with that - so be it. 

Youre ready. 

You nod to the baallkid to throw you a ball. You then walk yourself up to the baseline and glance down the other end. 

[[Your first serve]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="30" name="Your first serve" tags="" position="300,2375" size="100,100">You play a greaat service game. You can see Danani is now staarting to feel the pressure just from the frustration shes expressed to her team.

This spikes some hope in you. You can see shes now strtng to tense up. Youre only 2 points away from victory. 

Her second serve lands in and you smack a forehand down the line, exposing her weak backhand. She barely touches the ball. 

The ccrowd roars. 

Youre 1 point away from victory. 

You choose not to look at your team - although you can sense them starting to get all ecstatic and excited. Dani looks stressed down the other end. This is exctly what you want. 

The last thing you want to do is care how this nenxt point pans out. 

[[championship point]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="33" name="championship point" tags="" position="300,2750" size="100,100">
&lt;img class="story-image" src="./images/excitedcrowd.gif" alt="excitedcrowd" /&gt; 


Dani's first serve lands in. You strike a forehand down the middle. Her next shot is a nice forehand cross court - but you read it early and return it just as powerful back to her forehand. She targets your bakchand, but you get that bck as well. She starts scrambling for answers. After hitting a forehand she runs into the net. But its not a good shot to come in on and you easily return it with a forehand winner down the line. 



[[the crowd]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="34" name="the crowd" tags="" position="300,2875" size="100,100">You've won!! It takes a solid few moments for you to realise whats just happned. You finally beat Dani, youve taken teh title. You are now the womens singles champion!

This isn't ideal, and you start to become frustrated.  

You start to panic - things are now looking exactly like the last final you were in - which you lost. It was devastating. Your head starts to spin. You're trying desperately to come up with answers.  

On the change of ends you sit down and have a drink, hoping this will help calm your thoughts.  

You get distracted during the break, looking over at your team and wondering what they're thinking. Youâ€™re also aware that Dani is now a lot more confident, meaning she's going to be harder to beat.

[[The change of ends]] 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="40" name="The change of ends" tags="" position="725,1750" size="100,100">Youâ€™ve just lost the first set 6-1. The majority of the crowd is now in favour of Dani, or so it seems. You need to get out of the arena for a bit. There are too many distractions.  

You go to the umpire and ask if you can leave to go to the bathroom. He finds someone to accompany you there.  

Once you've closed the cubicle door, you take a deep breath and sit on top of the toilet seat. You just sit there. You can hear the music playing in the arena, the whoops and cheers from the crowd. They're probably participating in a giant Mexican wave or something.  

You know you're going to have to do something amazing to be able to turn this match around.  

You start to think - maybe you just need to hit more balls in. The ratio of unforced errors seems to be 20% Dani and 80% you. Maybe even more for you.  

"Just hit more balls in the court" you tell yourself. "Be more consistent. Make her have to earn the win, rather than just serving it to her."
